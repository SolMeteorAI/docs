## Step 2: Explore and Analyze Pools

Fabriq provides real-time visibility into liquidity pools across Meteora's DLMM and DAMM architecture.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Search or Browse">
    Discover active pools using the Trending Pools page.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Pool Data">
    Each pool displays live metrics such as:
    - **Trading volume**
    - **Liquidity**
    - **Fees per minute**
    - **Trades per minute**
    - **APR (when available)**
    - **Pool age**
    - **MeteorScore** (Fabriq's activity rating)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**These insights help traders and LPs understand market conditions before entering a position.**
</Info>

## Step 3: View Your Portfolio

When your wallet is connected, Fabriq automatically organizes your LP-related activity.

  <Card title="Active Positions" icon="chart-bar">
    Displays:
    - **Current position value**
    - **Initial deposit**
    - **Unclaimed fees**
    - **Claimed fees**
    - **LP-based PnL**
    - **Available actions** (Claim, Compound where supported, Close, Zap-Out)
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="History" icon="clock">

## Step 4: Manage Your LP Positions

<Warning>
**A connected wallet is required for position management.**
</Warning>

Fabriq centralizes all LP actions in one interface:

### Available Actions

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Position Controls" icon="gear">
    **→ Claim**: Harvest your accumulated fees  
    **→ Compound**: Reinvest rewards back into your position (when supported)  
    **→ Close and Zap-Out**: Exit your position and convert liquidity back into a single asset
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Analytics & Sharing" icon="image">
    **→ Generate PnL Card**: Download a share-ready LP performance summary
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
**Fabriq streamlines LP management, eliminating the need to jump between multiple platforms.**
</Info>

## Step 5: Reclaim SOL from Empty Token Accounts

Over time, interacting with pools creates empty token accounts that hold reclaimable SOL. Fabriq helps you recover it instantly.

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
**Keeping your wallet clean ensures your SOL is always working.**

## Fee Structure Summary

These fees apply only to actions supported within Fabriq:

| Action | Fee |
|--------|-----|
| **Claiming Rewards** | 2% |
