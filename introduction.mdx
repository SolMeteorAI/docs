![Fabriq Platform — Unifying Liquidity Provision on Solana](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SolMeteorAI/docs/main/images/PnL%20%2812%29.png)

Fabriq is a liquidity and market-intelligence tool for Liquidity Providers and active traders on Solana.

Fabriq provides real-time visibility into liquidity pools, fees, performance, and pool behavior using data indexed directly from on-chain activity. Information updates in real time as market conditions change, giving users a clear view of how liquidity is actually being used.

It is designed to help users make educated decisions before entering a liquidity pool.

Liquidity decisions are rarely based on a single data point. Volume, fees, pool structure, token behavior, and project context all matter. Fabriq brings these signals together in one place so users can evaluate pools with confidence, without switching between multiple tools.

Built natively for Solana, Fabriq supports advanced liquidity architectures such as DLMM and DAMM and brings pool discovery, performance monitoring, and liquidity analysis into a single interface.
