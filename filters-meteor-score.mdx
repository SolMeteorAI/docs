## ‚≠ê Understanding the Meteor Score

<Info>
**Fabriq's Meteor Score** is a proprietary algorithm that ranks liquidity pools to help you identify the strongest opportunities at a glance.
</Info>

### How It's Calculated

The Meteor Score evaluates pools based on three key factors:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="üìà Trade Activity" icon="chart-line">
    Average trades per minute across 5m, 1h, 6h, and 24h windows
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="üí∏ Fee Generation" icon="coins">
    Average fees earned per minute during the same timeframes
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="üåä Total Liquidity" icon="waves">
    Depth and stability of the pool
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Why Meteor Score Matters

<Tip>
**The higher the score, the stronger the opportunity.**

Use Meteor Score to instantly surface pools with:
- ‚úÖ **Real volume** (not wash trading)
- ‚úÖ **Sustainable APRs** (actual fee generation)  
- ‚úÖ **Trading potential** (active market participation)
</Tip>

<Warning>
A high Meteor Score indicates strong fundamentals, but always do your own research before investing in any pool.
</Warning>

## Filter Combination Examples

You can combine multiple filters for precise pool discovery:

```bash
# High-liquidity, established pools
"What are the best pools with minimum 500k liquidity, older than 7 days, and Meteor Score above 800?"

# New trending opportunities
"What are the best pools younger than 6 hours with positive price change and volume over 50k?"

# Safe, stable options
"What are the best SOL-USDC pools with minimum 1M liquidity and fee rate above 0.5% daily?"
```
