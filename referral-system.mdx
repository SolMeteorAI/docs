Every time your referrals claim, compound, or zap out—you earn SOL, passively.

**Coming Soon**: This feature isn't live yet, but will be available in an upcoming release.
</Warning>

## 🔧 How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Your Referral Takes Action">
    When someone you referred uses Fabriq and performs any fee-generating action:
    - **Claims** farming rewards
    - **Closes** a position  
    - **Zaps out** of a pool
    - **Uses SOL Redeem**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Protocol Fee Applied">
    A **2% protocol fee** is automatically applied to the transaction.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Fee Conversion">
    All fees are automatically swapped to SOL for simplified distribution.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Your Reward">
    You receive **10% of the total fee** in SOL, distributed automatically.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 💡 Referral Rewards Example

Let's walk through a real scenario:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Scenario">
    Your referral claims rewards from their farming position:
    
    **Claimed Rewards:**
    - 100 $TRUMP 
    - 100 $SOL
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Fee Calculation">
    **Protocol Fee (2%):**
    - 2% of 100 $TRUMP = 2 $TRUMP
    - 2% of 100 $SOL = 2 $SOL
    
    **Fee Conversion:**
    - 2 $TRUMP swapped to SOL
    - Total fee ≈ 4 SOL
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Your Earnings">
    **Your Referral Reward (10% of fee):**
    - 10% of 4 SOL = **0.4 SOL**
    - Sent automatically at 00:00 UTC
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
**Same Process**: This applies to compounding, closing positions, or zapping out—any action that generates protocol fees.
</Note>
