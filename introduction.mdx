## Introduction

Smart liquidity and market tools — built natively for Solana.

Fabriq is a unified liquidity and market-intelligence terminal designed for active traders and Liquidity Providers on Solana.

From discovering where real market activity is happening to managing LP positions, tracking fees, monitoring performance, and exiting with precision — Fabriq gives you full visibility and control in a single, streamlined interface.

Built natively for Solana and optimized for Meteora's advanced liquidity architecture (DLMM & DAMM), Fabriq replaces fragmented, multi-tab DeFi workflows with real-time, activity-driven tools — all in one place.
