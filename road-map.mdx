## Roadmap

From Core Infrastructure to Advanced Strategies

Evolving through clearly defined phases, each building on the last to deliver a complete, end-to-end terminal for liquidity providers and traders on Solana.

Our focus is simple: ship real utility first, then expand into advanced workflows, community features, and intelligent automation.

## Phase 1 — Core Foundation ✅ Complete

We shipped the essentials needed to power everything that follows.

**Delivered**

- LP agent foundation
- Clean trading interface
- Real-time market insights
- Basic LP position management

This phase established the core architecture and Solana-native performance.

## Phase 2 — Liquidity Tools Live ✅ Complete

Full control over LP positions, directly from the terminal.

**Delivered**

- Claim, compound, and close positions
- One-click LP actions
- Unified position management
- Streamlined LP lifecycle tools

Became an execution layer — not just a dashboard.

## Phase 3 — Terminal Upgrade 🚧 In Progress

Evolving into a full-featured trading and liquidity terminal.

**In Development**

- Advanced DEX integrations
- Live market data feeds
- Historical performance analysis
- Professional-grade trading tools

This phase transforms the platform from a utility into a competitive edge.

## Phase 4 — Community Engine 📋 Planned

Turning performance into visibility and engagement.

**Planned**

- Community leaderboards

This layer brings strategies, results, and users together.

## Phase 5 — Advanced Strategies 🔮 Future Vision

Becomes an adaptive system — not just a tool.
