![Fabriq Platform — Unifying Liquidity Provision on Solana](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SolMeteorAI/docs/main/images/PnL%20(3).png)

Fabriq is a liquidity and market-intelligence tool for Liquidity Providers and active traders on Solana.

Fabriq provides real-time visibility into liquidity pools, LP positions, fees, and performance. Data is indexed directly from on-chain activity and updates continuously as market conditions change.

The platform brings pool discovery, performance tracking, and portfolio visibility together in a single interface designed for active liquidity workflows.

Fabriq is built natively for Solana and supports advanced liquidity architectures such as DLMM and DAMM.

## Features

### Trending Pools

Trending Pools surface active liquidity pools using live on-chain metrics and usage signals.

Pools can be viewed using different scoring perspectives:

**→ Degen** — short-term activity  
**→ Multiday** — sustained activity  
**→ Bluechips** — established pools

Pools can be filtered, inspected, paused on hover, and pinned for quick access.

### LP Position Management

Fabriq allows users to manage liquidity positions from a single dashboard.

Supported actions include claiming rewards, compounding (where supported), closing positions, and zapping out.

### Live Fees & Performance

Fees, APR (where available), pool activity, and LP-based PnL are tracked in real time using on-chain data.

### Portfolio

The portfolio view displays positions, balances, performance history, and wallet activity in one place.
