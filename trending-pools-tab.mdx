title: Trending Pools Tab
description: 'Your real-time radar for active liquidity on Solana'
---

The Trending Pools tab surfaces liquidity pools with real on-chain activity across Meteora's DLMM and DAMM architecture.

Rather than focusing on price alone, it highlights usage, fee generation, and efficiency, helping traders and liquidity providers quickly identify where capital is actively flowing.

## Overview

Trending Pools provides a live, continuously updating view of active pools, accessible directly from the sidebar.

The layout is designed for speed and clarity—allowing users to compare pools, assess momentum, and filter opportunities without switching between tools or screens.

## 🔍 Discovering Opportunities

Trending Pools allows users to browse and search pools using real-time market data such as liquidity, volume, fees, and activity levels.

Pools can be sorted by any visible metric, making it easy to surface:

**→ High-activity pools**  
**→ Established liquidity with consistent fees**  
**→ Newer pools showing early momentum**

## Filtering & Custom Views

To reduce noise, Fabriq provides flexible filtering and column customization tools directly within the Trending Pools table.

Users can refine results based on factors such as:

**→ Pool structure (DLMM or DAMM)**  
**→ Liquidity and valuation**  
**→ Activity and volume**  
**→ Fees, APR, and price movement (when available)**

Columns can be shown or hidden to create a focused view tailored to individual strategies. Default layouts can be restored at any time.

![Filters and custom columns allow users to narrow the market and focus only on the metrics that matter to their strategy.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SolMeteorAI/docs/main/images/Trending%20Pools%20Filters%20View.png)

## MeteorScore

Each pool is ranked using MeteorScore, Fabriq's proprietary activity-based scoring model.

MeteorScore emphasizes real usage over static yield, helping highlight pools with meaningful participation rather than temporary spikes.

It considers factors such as:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Activity Metrics" icon="chart-candlestick">
    **→ Recent trading activity**  
    **→ Fee generation**
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Performance Analysis" icon="target">
    **→ Liquidity depth and efficiency**  
    **→ Short-term consistency across timeframes**
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Higher scores generally indicate healthier, more active pools relative to their liquidity.

## Security Badges

Trending Pools displays security badges directly in the table to surface important token characteristics at a glance.

Common badges include:

**→ Freezable Token** — the token contract can freeze transfers  
**→ Mintable Token** — the token supply can be expanded  
**→ Jupiter Verified** — the token has been verified by Jupiter Exchange

Badges are intended as signals, not guarantees, and should be considered alongside other market indicators.
