The Trending Pools tab displays liquidity pools with live on-chain activity across Meteora DLMM and DAMM pools.

All data is indexed directly from the blockchain and updates continuously. Trending Pools provides a real-time view of liquidity usage, fee generation, and pool activity.

## Overview

Trending Pools presents a continuously updating table of active liquidity pools.

The table is accessible from the sidebar and is designed for fast inspection and comparison of pools using live market data. No manual refresh is required.

## Pool Data

Each pool displays real-time metrics, including:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Core Metrics" icon="chart-line">
    **→ Trading volume**  
    **→ Liquidity**  
    **→ Pool age**  
    **→ APR (when available)**
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Activity Metrics" icon="signal">
    **→ Fees generated**  
    **→ Trades per minute**  
    **→ Liquidity participation**
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

All metrics reflect current on-chain activity.

## Fabriq Score

Each pool is evaluated using the Fabriq Score, an activity-based scoring system used to interpret pool behavior across different time horizons.

Fabriq Score is available in three variants.

### Fabriq Degen Score

The Fabriq Degen Score highlights short-term, high-frequency activity.

It evaluates:

**→ Recent trading activity**  
**→ Recent LP activity**  
**→ Fees paid to liquidity providers**  
**→ Liquidity balance**

Higher scores indicate stronger short-term activity and higher relative engagement.

### Fabriq Multiday Score

The Fabriq Multiday Score highlights sustained performance across multiple days.

It evaluates:

**→ Multi-day yield**  
**→ Price performance**

Higher scores indicate consistent activity and performance over time.

### Fabriq Bluechip Score

The Fabriq Bluechip Score identifies established pools with stable participation.

It evaluates:

**→ Multi-day yield**  
**→ Price performance**

Higher scores indicate longer-running pools with more consistent liquidity behavior.

Users can switch between Fabriq Score variants to view the same pools through different activity and stability lenses.

## Sorting, Filtering, and Views

Trending Pools supports table-level controls for refining results.

Users can:

**→ Sort pools by any visible metric**  
**→ Filter by pool structure (DLMM or DAMM)**  
**→ Filter by liquidity, volume, activity, fees, APR, and valuation**  
**→ Show or hide columns**  
**→ Restore default layouts**

All filters and sorting apply instantly to live data.

## Interaction Tools

Trending Pools includes interaction tools for fast-moving data:

**→ Pause on hover to inspect pool metrics without stopping table updates**  
**→ Pin pools to keep selected pools fixed at the top of the table**

These tools allow users to monitor specific pools while continuing to track overall activity.

## Security Badges

Pools display security badges to surface token characteristics:

**→ Freezable Token** — token transfers can be frozen  
**→ Mintable Token** — token supply can be expanded  
**→ Jupiter Exchange Verified** — token verified by Jupiter

Badges are informational and should be considered alongside other metrics.
