The Trending Pools tab displays liquidity pools with live on-chain activity across Meteora DLMM and DAMM pools.

All data is indexed directly from the blockchain and updates in real-time. Trending Pools provides a real-time view of liquidity usage, fee generation, and pool activity.

## Overview

Trending Pools presents a real-time updating table of active liquidity pools.

The table is accessible from the sidebar and is designed for fast inspection and comparison of pools using live market data. No manual refresh is required.

## Pool Data

Each pool displays real-time metrics, including:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Core Metrics" icon="chart-line">
    Trading volume  
    Liquidity  
    Pool age  
    APR (when available)
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Activity Metrics" icon="signal">
    Fees generated  
    Trades per minute  
    Liquidity participation
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

All metrics reflect current on-chain activity.

## Fabriq Score

Each pool is evaluated using an activity-based scoring system that interprets pool behavior across different time horizons.

Fabriq scores are available in four variants.

## Interaction Tools

Trending Pools includes tools designed for fast-moving data:

These tools allow users to monitor specific pools while continuing to track overall market activity.

## Pool, Token, and Project Information

Alongside pool metrics, Trending Pools surfaces additional pool-level and token-level information to help users make more informed decisions before entering a position.

![Pool, Token, and Project Information](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SolMeteorAI/docs/main/images/PnL%20%2816%29.png)

This information may include:

- Token identifiers and metadata
- Project links, socials, and launch origin (when available)
- Fee structure details, including base fees, dynamic fees, and total effective fees
- Liquidity composition, such as total pool liquidity, permanently locked liquidity, and open positions
- Activity and participation signals, including volume, fees, transactions, makers, and activity quality indicators
- Token configuration and risk signals, such as mint authority, freeze authority, holder concentration, and audit-related indicators

Pools also display security badges to surface key token characteristics:

- **Freezable Token** — token transfers can be frozen
- **Mintable Token** — token supply can be expanded
- **Jupiter Verified** — token verified by Jupiter

All information is displayed directly within the pool view so users can evaluate liquidity behavior, token properties, and project context without relying on external tools.

Trending Pools is designed to give users a clear, real-time view of liquidity activity so pools can be evaluated with context before entering a position.
