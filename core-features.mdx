Fabriq provides core capabilities for Liquidity Providers and traders to discover active liquidity pools, track liquidity activity, evaluate pool behavior, and manage positions from a single interface.

## Discover Opportunity — Trending Pools

The Trending Pools tab continuously indexes live pool data across supported liquidity programs, including Meteora DLMM and DAMM pools.

It surfaces pools based on current on-chain activity, allowing users to see where liquidity is actively being used.

### Key Signals

  <Card title="Core Metrics" icon="chart-line">
    **→ Trading volume**  
    **→ Liquidity**

  <Card title="Activity Metrics" icon="signal">
    **→ Fees per minute**

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

These metrics update continuously and reflect real-time pool usage and fee generation.

### Scoring Views

Trending Pools support multiple scoring perspectives to reflect different liquidity environments:

**→ Degen** — short-term, high-frequency activity  
**→ Multiday** — sustained activity across longer timeframes  
**→ Bluechips** — established pools with consistent participation

Users can switch between scoring views based on their strategy.

### Interaction Tools

Trending Pools include tools designed for fast-moving data:

**→ Pause on hover to inspect pool metrics**  
**→ Pin pools to keep selected pools fixed at the top of the table**  
**→ Filtering by liquidity, volume, pool age, APR, and activity metrics**
