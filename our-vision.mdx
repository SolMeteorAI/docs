Unifying Liquidity Provision Across Solana

Brings together liquidity data from every major DEX and sits above individual protocols to show how liquidity moves, concentrates, and sticks across the ecosystem, so LPs can allocate capital with a complete view of Solana liquidity.

## The Problem

Each DEX exposes only its own pools. LPs are forced to jump between tools to understand where capital is deployed, how it moves, and which pools offer sustainable returns.

    Each DEX shows only its own pools, forcing you to switch between platforms

  <Card title="Incomplete view" icon="eye-slash">
    No single view of Solana liquidity as a system
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Isolated decisions" icon="link-slash">
    Can't evaluate pools side-by-side across different protocols
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

What's missing: a single, reliable view of Solana liquidity as a system.

## The Solution

Connects the ecosystem instead of competing within it, unifying cross-DEX liquidity data, real-time liquidity movement, and historical pool performance into one system.

  <Card title="Historical context" icon="clock">
    **Two+ years of historical data** to evaluate pool performance over time
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Integrated terminal" icon="terminal">
    **Full LP lifecycle** from discovery and execution through portfolio management
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Lets you evaluate pools side-by-side rather than in isolation, with data made directly actionable through an integrated terminal.

## Why Now

LPing is no longer experimental. With larger and more mobile capital, faster rotation, and real-time liquidity shifts, the market needs infrastructure that works across platforms—not another LP interface tied to a single DEX.

## Platform-Agnostic by Design

Built for how liquidity actually moves, durable across market cycles, and avoids the failure modes of single-DEX tools.

<Info>
**Infrastructure, not just another interface.**

Turns fragmented liquidity data into actionable LP decisions. The shared decision layer LPs rely on across Solana.

<Note>
**Built by active LPs** with full control over the liquidity data pipeline, operating on a platform-agnostic architecture that benefits from a compounding historical dataset.
