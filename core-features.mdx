Fabriq provides two core capabilities designed to help traders and Liquidity Providers navigate Solana's DeFi ecosystem with clarity and confidence:

**Trending Pools** — discover where activity is happening

**Portfolio Tab** — manage and monitor LP positions in real time

Together, these features allow users to identify opportunities, evaluate momentum, and manage liquidity without relying on fragmented tools or external dashboards.

## Discover Opportunity — Trending Pools

The Trending Pools tab is the foundation of Fabriq.

It continuously monitors live pool data across Meteora's DLMM and DAMM pools to surface where real market activity is occurring.

Rather than relying on price alone, Trending Pools focuses on usage, demand, and efficiency—helping users spot momentum early.

## Focus the Signal — Filters & MeteorScore

Fabriq layers intelligent filtering and scoring on top of raw pool data to reduce noise and surface meaningful opportunities.

### Filters

Users can refine pools based on:

**→ Liquidity thresholds**  
**→ Volume levels**  
**→ Pool age**  
**→ APR and activity metrics**

### MeteorScore

MeteorScore is Fabriq's proprietary activity-based score designed to highlight pools gaining traction.

It evaluates:

    **→ Trades per minute**  
    **→ Fees per minute**
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Performance Analysis" icon="target">
    **→ Liquidity efficiency**  
    **→ Performance across multiple timeframes**
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Higher MeteorScores indicate stronger, more consistent participation rather than short-lived spikes.

## Manage Positions — Portfolio Tab

The Portfolio Tab is where users manage their active Liquidity Provider positions.

It provides a consolidated view of all LP positions with real-time insights and direct actions.

## Improve Capital Efficiency — Zap-Out & SOL Reclaim

Fabriq includes tools that help users reduce friction and recover value.

### Zap-Out

Exit LP positions efficiently without manual unwinding, reducing steps and execution complexity.

### SOL Reclaim

Fabriq automatically detects empty token accounts and allows users to reclaim stranded SOL with one click.

<Warning>
**Fee Structure**: A 10% fee applies to reclaimed SOL. Fee covers transaction costs and platform maintenance.
</Warning>

These features help users keep capital deployed efficiently rather than locked in forgotten accounts.
