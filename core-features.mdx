Core capabilities for Liquidity Providers and traders to discover active liquidity pools, track liquidity activity, evaluate pool behavior, and manage positions from a single interface.

## Trending Pools

The Trending Pools tab indexes live pool data across supported liquidity programs, including Meteora DLMM and DAMM pools.

It surfaces pools based on current on-chain activity, allowing users to see where liquidity is actively being used.

### Key Signals

  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Activity Metrics" icon="signal">
    Fees per minute

    Activity-based scores
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

These metrics update in real-time and reflect current pool usage and fee generation.

### Scoring Views

Trending Pools support multiple scoring perspectives to reflect different liquidity environments:

- **Degen** — short-term, high-frequency activity
- **Multiday** — sustained activity across longer timeframes
- **Bluechips** — established pools with consistent participation

Users can switch between scoring views based on their strategy.

- Pause on hover to inspect pool metrics
- Pin pools to keep selected pools fixed at the top of the table
