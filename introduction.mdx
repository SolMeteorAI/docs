## Smart tools for traders and LPs — built for Solana.

Fabriq is a unified liquidity and market-insight platform designed to simplify and supercharge your experience as a Liquidity Provider or active trader on Solana.

From discovering active pools to managing LP positions, tracking fees, monitoring pool performance, and exiting with precision — Fabriq gives you full visibility and control in one streamlined terminal.

Built natively for Solana and optimized for Meteora's advanced liquidity architecture (DLMM & DAMM), Fabriq eliminates the friction of multi-tab DeFi workflows and replaces it with real-time, actionable tools — all in one place.
