Discover and manage liquidity on Solana with Fabriq

Fabriq helps traders and Liquidity Providers discover active pools, evaluate real market activity, and manage LP positions through a clear, step-by-step workflow.

This guide explains how Fabriq works from exploration to ongoing position management.

## Step 1: Access Fabriq

Fabriq is available through both web and mobile browsers.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Web" icon="globe">
    **Full access** to Trending Pools, Portfolio insights, and LP management tools
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Mobile" icon="smartphone">
    **Full-featured experience** optimized for viewing activity and managing positions on the go
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Connecting your wallet unlocks:

**→ Portfolio visibility**  
**→ Active LP position tracking**  
**→ Claiming, compounding, closing, and zap-out actions**

## Step 2: Discover Active Pools

Fabriq continuously monitors liquidity pools across Meteora's DLMM and DAMM architecture.

Using the Trending Pools tab, users can:

**→ Browse or search active pools**  
**→ Identify pools with rising activity and fee generation**  
**→ Compare opportunities using real-time metrics**

Each pool surfaces key indicators such as liquidity, volume, activity levels, and MeteorScore to help users assess conditions before entering a position.

## Step 3: Evaluate Activity with Filters & MeteorScore

To reduce noise and focus on meaningful opportunities, Fabriq provides:

**→ Flexible filters** for liquidity, volume, pool age, and activity  
**→ MeteorScore**, Fabriq's activity-based scoring model

MeteorScore highlights pools gaining traction by analyzing:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Activity Metrics" icon="chart-candlestick">
    **→ Trades per minute**  
    **→ Fees per minute**
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Performance Analysis" icon="target">
    **→ Liquidity efficiency across timeframes**
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

This allows users to prioritize pools showing consistent, organic usage rather than short-lived spikes.

## Step 4: Monitor & Manage Your Portfolio

Once your wallet is connected, Fabriq automatically organizes all LP-related activity in the Portfolio Tab.

Users can view:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Position Overview" icon="chart-bar">
    **→ Active LP positions**  
    **→ Current position value and exposure**  
    **→ Unclaimed and claimed fees**  
    **→ LP-based PnL**
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Position Controls" icon="gear">
    **→ Claim rewards**  
    **→ Compound (where supported)**  
    **→ Close positions**  
    **→ Zap out into a single asset**
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Fabriq centralizes LP management into a single, streamlined experience—eliminating the need to switch between tools.

## Step 5: Reclaim Stranded SOL

Interacting with Solana DeFi often creates empty token accounts that still hold reclaimable SOL.

Fabriq automatically:

  <Card title="Automatic Scan" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **Scans for empty token accounts**
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="One-Click Reclaim" icon="bolt">
    **Allows users to reclaim SOL in one click**
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Fee Structure" icon="percent">
    **A 10% fee applies** to cover transaction costs and platform upkeep
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Fees (Where Applicable)

Fabriq applies fees only to specific supported actions:

| Action | Fee |
|--------|-----|
| **Claiming rewards** | 2% |
| **Zap-Out** | 1% |
| **SOL Reclaim** | 10% |

<Note>
**No other actions are currently subject to fees.**
</Note>

## The Fabriq Advantage

Fabriq simplifies the liquidity workflow by combining:

  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Portfolio Management" icon="wallet">
    **→ Clear portfolio visibility**  
    **→ Direct LP position controls**
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

By focusing on what is active, what is working, and how your liquidity is performing, Fabriq provides a more efficient way to participate in Solana's liquidity ecosystem.
