---

Discover active pools, evaluate real market activity, and manage LP positions through a clear, step-by-step workflow.

This guide walks through the workflow from exploration to ongoing position management.

## Step 1: Access

Available through both web and mobile browsers.

  <Card title="Web" icon="globe">
    **Full access** to Trending Pools and LP management tools
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Mobile" icon="phone">
    **Full-featured experience** optimized for viewing activity and managing positions on the go
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Connecting your wallet unlocks:

- Active LP position tracking
- Claiming, compounding, closing, and zap-out actions

## Step 2: Discover Active Pools

Continuously monitors liquidity pools across Meteora's DLMM and DAMM architecture.

Using the Trending Pools tab, you can:

- Browse or search active pools
- Identify pools with rising activity and fee generation
- Compare opportunities using real-time metrics

Each pool surfaces key indicators such as liquidity, volume, activity levels, and Fabriq Score to help users assess conditions before entering a position.

## Step 3: Evaluate Activity with Filters & Fabriq Score

To reduce noise and focus on meaningful opportunities:

- **Flexible filters** for liquidity, volume, pool age, and activity
- **Fabriq Score**, an activity-based scoring model

Fabriq Score highlights pools gaining traction by analyzing:

  <Card title="Activity Metrics" icon="chart-candlestick">
    Trades per minute  
    Fees per minute
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Performance Analysis" icon="chart-bar">
    Liquidity efficiency across timeframes
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

This allows users to prioritize pools showing consistent, organic usage rather than short-lived spikes.

## Step 4: Reclaim Stranded SOL

Interacting with Solana DeFi often creates empty token accounts that still hold reclaimable SOL.

Automatically:

    **Allows users to reclaim SOL in one click**
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Fee Structure" icon="percent">
    **A 10% fee applies** to cover transaction costs and platform upkeep
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Fees (Where Applicable)

Fees apply only to specific supported actions:

| Action | Fee |
|--------|-----|
| **Claiming** | 2% |
| **Swapping** | 1% |
| **Token account closing** | 10% |

<Note>
**No other actions are currently subject to fees.**
</Note>

## The Advantage

Simplifies the liquidity workflow by combining:

  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Position Management" icon="wallet">
