## Fabriq Roadmap

From Core Infrastructure to Autonomous Strategies

Fabriq is evolving through clearly defined phases, each building on the last to deliver a complete, end-to-end terminal for liquidity providers and traders on Solana.

Our focus is simple: ship real utility first, then expand into advanced workflows, community features, and intelligent automation.

## Phase 1 — Core Foundation ✅ Complete

We shipped the essentials needed to power everything that follows.

**Delivered**

**→ LP agent foundation**  
**→ Clean trading interface**  
**→ Real-time market insights**  
**→ Basic LP position management**

This phase established Fabriq's core architecture and Solana-native performance.

## Phase 2 — Liquidity Tools Live ✅ Complete

Full control over LP positions, directly from the terminal.

**Delivered**

**→ Claim, compound, and close positions**  
**→ One-click LP actions**  
**→ Unified position management**  
**→ Streamlined LP lifecycle tools**

Fabriq became an execution layer — not just a dashboard.

## Phase 3 — Terminal Upgrade 🚧 In Progress

Evolving Fabriq into a full-featured trading and liquidity terminal.

**In Development**

**→ Advanced DEX integrations**  
**→ Live market data feeds**  
**→ Historical performance analysis**  
**→ Professional-grade trading tools**

This phase transforms Fabriq from a utility into a competitive edge.

## Phase 4 — Community Engine 📋 Planned

Turning performance into visibility and engagement.

**Planned**

**→ Gamification and performance recognition**  
**→ Social trading integrations**  
**→ Alerts and notifications**  
**→ Community leaderboards**

This layer brings strategies, results, and users together.

## Phase 5 — Autonomous Strategies 🔮 Future Vision

The long-term evolution: intelligence between users and the market.

**Vision**

**→ AI-assisted portfolio management**  
**→ Autonomous liquidity strategies**  
**→ Intelligent trade execution**  
**→ Predictive market insights**

Fabriq becomes an adaptive system — not just a tool.
