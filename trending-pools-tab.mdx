The Trending Pools tab displays liquidity pools with live on-chain activity across Meteora DLMM and DAMM pools.

All data is indexed directly from the blockchain and updates in real-time. Trending Pools provides a real-time view of liquidity usage, fee generation, and pool activity.

## Overview

Trending Pools presents a real-time updating table of active liquidity pools.

The table is accessible from the sidebar and is designed for fast inspection and comparison of pools using live market data. No manual refresh is required.

## Pool Data

Each pool displays real-time metrics, including:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Core Metrics" icon="chart-line">
    Trading volume  
    Liquidity  
    Pool age  
    APR (when available)
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Activity Metrics" icon="signal">
    Fees generated  
    Trades per minute  
    Liquidity participation
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

All metrics reflect current on-chain activity.

## Fabriq Score

Each pool is evaluated using an activity-based scoring system that interprets pool behavior across different time horizons.

Available in three variants.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Fabriq Degen Score" icon="bolt">
    Highlights short-term, high-frequency activity.
    
    **Evaluates:**
    - Recent trading activity
    - Recent LP activity
    - Fees paid to liquidity providers
    - Liquidity balance
    
    Higher scores indicate stronger short-term activity and higher relative engagement.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Fabriq Multiday Score" icon="chart-line">
    Highlights sustained performance across multiple days.
    
    **Evaluates:**
    - Multi-day yield
    - Price performance
    
    Higher scores indicate consistent activity and performance over time.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Fabriq Bluechip Score" icon="shield">
    Identifies established pools with stable participation.
    
    **Evaluates:**
    - Multi-day yield
    - Price performance
    
    Higher scores indicate longer-running pools with more consistent liquidity behavior.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Users can switch between Fabriq Score variants to view pools through different activity and stability lenses.

## Search, Filters, and Views

Trending Pools includes flexible controls to help users narrow results and focus on relevant pools.

Users can:

- Search pools by name, token symbol, or token address
- Filter pools based on liquidity, activity, valuation, and pool structure
- Sort pools by any visible metric

Filters and sorting apply instantly to live data.

For a complete list of available filters and metrics, see [Trending Pools — Filters & Metrics](/trending-pools-tab/filters-metrics).

## Column Customization

Users can customize which columns are visible in the table.

Columns can be added or removed based on strategy and preference, allowing users to focus only on the metrics that matter to them. Layouts can be reset to default at any time.

## Interaction Tools

Trending Pools includes tools designed for fast-moving data:

- Pause on hover to inspect pool metrics without stopping updates
- Pin pools to keep selected pools fixed at the top of the table

These tools allow users to monitor specific pools while continuing to track overall market activity.

## Pool, Token, and Project Information

Alongside pool metrics, Trending Pools surfaces additional pool-level and token-level information to help users make more informed decisions before entering a position.

This information may include:

- Token identifiers and metadata
- Project links, socials, and launch origin (when available)
- Fee structure details, including base fees, dynamic fees, and total effective fees
- Liquidity composition, such as total pool liquidity, permanently locked liquidity, and open positions
- Activity and participation signals, including volume, fees, transactions, makers, and activity quality indicators
- Token configuration and risk signals, such as mint authority, freeze authority, holder concentration, and audit-related indicators

Pools also display security badges to surface key token characteristics:

- **Freezable Token** — token transfers can be frozen
- **Mintable Token** — token supply can be expanded
- **Jupiter Verified** — token verified by Jupiter

All information is displayed directly within the pool view so users can evaluate liquidity behavior, token properties, and project context without relying on external tools.
