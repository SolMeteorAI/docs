Your complete view of liquidity positions and performance on Solana

The Portfolio tab consolidates all liquidity-related activity for your connected wallet into a single, real-time dashboard.

It brings together active LP positions, performance analytics, historical actions, on-chain transactions, and wallet balances—giving traders and liquidity providers full visibility into their portfolio at a glance.

## Overview

The Portfolio tab is designed to centralize everything that happens after entering a pool.

From monitoring performance to managing positions and reviewing historical activity, all portfolio-related information updates automatically as you interact with liquidity pools and your wallet.

## Performance & PnL Tracking

The Portfolio tab includes built-in performance analytics that help users understand how their liquidity activity evolves over time.

Users can:

**→ View realized PnL as a chart or calendar**  
**→ Adjust analysis across multiple timeframes (daily, weekly, monthly)**  
**→ Switch performance ranges (7D, 1M, 6M, 1Y, YTD, All)**

This allows both short-term monitoring and long-term performance review without leaving the dashboard.

## Active Positions Summary

At the top of the Portfolio tab, an overview panel provides a high-level snapshot of current portfolio exposure and results.

It summarizes key portfolio totals such as:

**→ Active positions and pools**  
**→ Deposits and withdrawals**  
**→ Claimed and unclaimed fees**  
**→ LP-based PnL and current value**

This view is designed for quick orientation before drilling into individual positions.

## Active Positions

Active Positions displays all liquidity positions currently held by the connected wallet.

Each position row provides immediate insight into:

**→ Position performance**  
**→ Liquidity distribution**  
**→ Pool type (DLMM or DAMM)**  
**→ Position age and activity**

Positions can be expanded to reveal additional details and management controls.

## Managing Positions

Liquidity positions can be managed directly from the Portfolio tab without switching tools.

Available actions include:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Position Controls" icon="gear">
    **→ Claim accumulated fees**  
    **→ Compound rewards back into the position (when supported)**  
    **→ Close a position**  
    **→ Zap-Out, converting a position into a single asset in one action**
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

These controls allow users to adjust, rebalance, or exit liquidity efficiently as market conditions change.

## History

The History view records completed liquidity activity associated with the wallet.

It provides a chronological record of:

**→ Position initialization and closure**  
**→ Liquidity additions and removals**  
**→ Claims and compounds**

This section offers transparency and a clear audit trail of past portfolio activity.

## Transactions

The Transactions view surfaces relevant on-chain activity tied specifically to liquidity operations.

It allows users to:

**→ Verify execution of LP actions**  
**→ Review transaction types and pool structure**  
**→ Trace liquidity-related token movements**

This focused view reduces the need to rely on external explorers for portfolio verification.

## Balances

The Balances view displays all tokens currently held in the connected wallet.

It includes:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Token Information" icon="coins">
    **→ Token balances and values**  
    **→ Price and valuation data (when available)**
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Holdings" icon="wallet">
    **→ Both idle assets and liquidity-related holdings**
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

This provides a complete snapshot of wallet distribution alongside LP activity.

## Wallet & Token Management

Across both Trending Pools and Portfolio, Fabriq allows users to:

**→ Search for wallets and tokens**  
**→ Save and label wallets**  
**→ Quickly switch views for monitoring and analysis**

This makes tracking multiple wallets or assets seamless across the platform.

## Why the Portfolio Tab

The Portfolio tab brings liquidity management together by offering:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Performance Insight" icon="chart-line">
    **Clear performance insight** into LP-based results
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Direct Control" icon="gear">
    **Direct control** over active positions
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Full Visibility" icon="eye">
    **Full visibility** into historical actions and wallet state
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

By centralizing monitoring and management, the Portfolio tab helps users stay informed, efficient, and in control of their liquidity on Solana.
