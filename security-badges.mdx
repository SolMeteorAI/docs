## 🛡️ Badge Types

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="🧊 Freezable Token Badge" icon="snowflake">
    **What it means:** Indicates the token's contract can freeze transactions, potentially blocking sales.
    
    **Use Cases:**
    - 🔹 Sometimes used for compliance and regulatory requirements
    
    **Risks:**
    - ⚠️ Can be abused to trap users and prevent selling — always verify the project's legitimacy
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="🪙 Mintable Token Badge" icon="coins">
    **What it means:** The token contract allows minting of new supply.
    
    **Use Cases:**
    - 🔹 Can be fine if properly controlled and transparent
    
    **Risks:**
    - ⚠️ Unchecked minting = inflation risk or potential rug pull — research tokenomics carefully
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="✅ Verified by Jupiter Exchange" icon="check-circle">
    **What it means:** The token has been verified by Jupiter Exchange.
    
    **Benefits:**
    - 🔹 Adds credibility and trust to the token
    - 🔹 Shows the token has passed Jupiter's verification process
    
    **Important Note:**
    - ⚠️ Verification is not a guarantee of safety — always DYOR (Do Your Own Research)
  </Card>

## 🚨 Risk Assessment Guide

Understanding what each badge means for your investment decisions:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="🧊 Freezable Tokens">
    ### What to Look For:
    - **Project transparency** about freeze functionality
    - **Clear use case** for freeze capability (regulatory compliance, security)
    - **History of usage** - has the freeze been used maliciously before?
    
    ### Red Flags:
    - No explanation for freeze functionality
    - Anonymous or unverified team
    - Recent launch with freeze capability
    
    <Warning>
    **High Risk**: Freezable tokens can completely block your ability to sell. Only invest in projects you thoroughly trust.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="🪙 Mintable Tokens">
    ### What to Research:
    - **Maximum supply** limits and caps
    - **Minting schedule** and controlled release
    - **Team control** over minting functions
    
    ### Safe Indicators:
    - Transparent tokenomics documentation
    - Time-locked or multi-sig minting controls
    - Clear utility for new token creation
    
    <Warning>
    **Inflation Risk**: Unlimited minting can dilute your holdings. Verify the project's minting policies and controls.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="✅ Jupiter Verified">
    ### What This Means:
    - Token has passed Jupiter's verification process
    - Increased visibility on Jupiter's platform
    - Basic legitimacy check completed
    
    ### Still Need to Check:
    - Project fundamentals and team
    - Tokenomics and utility
    - Community and adoption
    
    <Note>
    **Additional Layer**: Verification adds credibility but doesn't guarantee investment success. Continue your due diligence.

## ⚖️ Risk Combinations

Understanding multiple badges on a single token:

| Badge Combination | Risk Level | Recommendation |
|------------------|------------|----------------|
| **Freezable + Mintable** | 🔴 High | Extreme caution - both major risks present |
| **Freezable + Jupiter Verified** | 🟡 Medium | Research project's freeze policy thoroughly |
| **Mintable + Jupiter Verified** | 🟡 Medium | Check tokenomics and minting controls |
| **Jupiter Verified Only** | 🟢 Lower | Still conduct full due diligence |
| **No Verification** | 🔴 High | Extra research required |

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: Use security badges as your first filter, but never make investment decisions based solely on badges. They're tools to guide your research, not final verdicts.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Remember**: No badge system can eliminate all risks in DeFi. Always DYOR and never invest more than you can afford to lose.
</Warning>

## 🧠 Stay Informed. Stay Sharp.

Security badges are just one layer of Fabriq's comprehensive risk assessment tools. Combined with:
- Meteor Score analysis
- Community verification tools
- Real-time market data
- Social sentiment tracking

You get a complete picture to make smarter, safer DeFi decisions.
