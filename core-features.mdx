## In-House Indexer

Powered by an in-house indexer that processes on-chain liquidity data in real time on Solana.

The indexer tracks pool state and activity directly from the blockchain, including liquidity changes, trading volume, swaps, and fees. All data shown is derived from the indexed on-chain data and updates as activity occurs in real-time.

## Trending Pools

Trending Pools brings together the data users need when evaluating a liquidity pool.

Pools are displayed using real-time metrics such as liquidity, volume, fees, and activity, allowing users to compare how pools are behaving under current market conditions. Multiple scoring views are available to help interpret different activity patterns across pools.

Trending Pools is designed to give users enough information to evaluate pools directly, without relying on separate analytics tools.

### Scoring Views

Pools can be viewed through different scoring perspectives, each highlighting a different type of activity:

- **Degen** — focuses on short-term, high-frequency activity
- **Multiday** — highlights sustained activity across longer timeframes
- **Bluechip** — surfaces established pools with consistent participation

Scores update based on live on-chain activity and can be switched at any time.

## Pool and Token Information

Alongside market data, Fabriq surfaces supporting information related to each pool and its underlying token.

This includes token identifiers, project links and socials (when available), and indicators related to token properties. This information is shown in context so users can review both liquidity behavior and project details in one place.

## Wallet Utilities

When a wallet is connected, Fabriq includes utilities that help users manage on-chain state while reviewing pools.

For example, empty token accounts can be closed directly from the interface, allowing users to reclaim SOL.

Everything you need to discover pools efficiently.
