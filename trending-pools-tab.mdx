Your real-time radar for the most active and relevant liquidity pools on Solana.

The Trending Pools Tab is designed to surface high-activity pools across Meteora's DLMM and DAMM architecture. It provides a fast way to identify opportunities, monitor market movement, and filter for pools that match your strategy.

## Fast, Intuitive Navigation

The Trending Pools Tab is accessible directly from the sidebar.

One click brings you into a real-time view of active pools, complete with sortable metrics that update continuously.

## Sorting and Column Customization

The Trending Pools table allows complete control over how information is displayed:

### Sorting

You can sort by any displayed column, including MeteorScore, liquidity, volume, fees, age, APR (where applicable), or price movement.

### Column Customization

## MeteorScore Integration

Each pool is ranked with Fabriq's MeteorScore, which evaluates:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Activity Metrics" icon="chart-candlestick">
    **→ Recent trading activity**  
    **→ Recent LP activity**
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Performance Metrics" icon="coins">
    **→ Fees paid to liquidity providers**  
    **→ Liquidity**
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
**Higher MeteorScores indicate pools with stronger short-term efficiency and momentum.**
